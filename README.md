# My Pset1 (Windows OS and Persistence)

## 1. Execute Windows Program At Startup Using Registry Editor

### Below is my detailed process of how I was able to execute my calculator application (calc.exe) at startup of my windows OS. The process I'll show you below includes mistakes I made before I finally suceeded at my assigned problem set.

The Windows registry editor contains the informations and settings of the PC. It reflects and stores all changes made on the PC. For example, if changes were made to a file's control settings, or if a seperate user on the PC makes changes to their screensaver, all these changes are stored in the registry editor and used for future reference and execution. 

The registry editor is also responsible for executing startup processes at default and its possible to instruct the registry editor to execute any application of your choice at the startup of the PC.

Below are steps I used to execute "calc.exe" at the startup of my Windows 10 OS
